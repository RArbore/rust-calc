# rust-calc
```rust-calc``` is an extremely simple command-line calculator written in rust. It parses expressions containing (), +, -, *, /, and numbers, and prints the result. ```rust-calc``` reads in expressions from stdin, and outputs the results to stdout (or if it cannot parse the input, an error to stderr).
